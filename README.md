## Summary 

My first ever full stack website I have ever created. Although it was challenging learning how to implement a back end server I felt like my programming skills grew the most with creating this app. Due to the high number of moving parts of this app, I felt like my debugging skills were coming toegether when I created this app. I felt really comfortable navigating inside the developer console to debug the issues I ran into whenever I was constructing each individual piece. Reflecting back, I would say the creation of this application gave me the confidence I needed to get out there and start applying for software developer roles, especially now that I am seeing the bigger picture of what skills a developer needs to code professionally.
